# Introduction to Nexus-NRS

Nexus-NRS (Nuclear Reaction Suite) is a Clojure library for nuclear reaction calculations: scattering, transfer (DWBA), inelastic reactions, and halo nuclei. It uses Riccati–Numerov integration and optical potentials for distorted waves.

See the [README](../README.md) for setup, usage, and the web dashboard.
