(defn calculate-anc
  "Calculate Asymptotic Normalization Coefficient (ANC) from a MODEL bound state wavefunction.
   
   The ANC C is the coefficient in the asymptotic form:

   This fits the tail of the wavefunction produced by the potential used in
   solve-bound-state (e.g. Woods-Saxon). Prefer using ANCs from experimental
   data (e.g. (d,p) analysis) when available; pass those directly to
   anc-normalized-overlap or other callers instead of calling this.
   
   Parameters:
   - u: Bound state wavefunction (vector)
   - E: Bound state energy (MeV, negative)
   - l: Orbital angular momentum
   - mass-factor: Mass factor (2μ/ħ²) in MeV⁻¹·fm⁻²
   - h: Step size (fm)
   - r-fit-min: Minimum radius for fitting (fm, should be outside nuclear potential)
   - r-fit-max: Maximum radius for fitting (fm)

   T = D₀ · φ*_f(0) · φ_i(0)
   
   However, for l > 0 states, φ(0) = 0, so we need the full overlap integral.

   This corresponds to the standard Yukawa potential form.
   
   Parameters:

   Returns: F_Y(r)

   **M_B = M_A + M_x**). Pass **`:zr-chi-exit-mass-ratio`** `(M_A/M_B)` in the optional **opts** map

   Parameters:

     the radial **F_{ℓsj}(r)** factor is **`F-lsj-r-from-bound-reduced-u`** (**R_{φ_f}^* R_{φ_i}**).
     **`transfer-amplitude-post`** uses that vector inside the ZR POST integrand (with **χ**, **D₀**, **r²**).

(defn lea-transfer-amplitude
  "Calculate transfer amplitude using Local Energy Approximation (LEA) with Hulthen potential.
   
   LEA approximates the transfer amplitude by evaluating the overlap at the local energy
   of the transferred particle. For (d,p) reactions, the deuteron is described by a
   Hulthen wavefunction.
   
   The LEA amplitude is:
   T_LEA = D₀ · ∫ φ*_f(r) φ_Hulthen(r) r² dr
   
   where φ_Hulthen is the Hulthen wavefunction for the deuteron.
   
   Parameters:
   - phi-f: Final bound state wavefunction (vector) - nucleon bound in final nucleus
   - alpha: Hulthen range parameter α (fm⁻¹), typically 0.23 fm⁻¹ for deuteron
   - beta: Hulthen range parameter β (fm⁻¹), typically 1.0-1.5 fm⁻¹
   - r-max: Maximum radius (fm)
   - h: Step size (fm)

   dσ/dΩ(θ) ∝ Σ_L |w_L·T_L|² · |Y_L0(θ, 0)|² (**incoherent** multipoles: no **L–L′** cross terms).
   This is **not** isotropic when **several** **L** contribute — each term varies with **θ** via **|Y_L0|² ∝ P_L(cos θ)²**;
   only the **interference** pattern differs from **`transfer-angular-distribution-coherent`**
   (**|Σ_L w_L T_L Y_L0|²**). When l-i and l-f are given, w_L is the selection weight (1 if L allowed, 0 if forbidden
   by triangle/parity), so some L dominate, others suppressed.
   
   Parameters:
   - T-amplitudes: Map of {L → T_L} transfer amplitudes for each angular momentum
   - theta: Scattering angle (radians)
   - phi: Azimuthal angle (radians, default 0 for coplanar scattering)

  **w_L** = `transfer-L-selection-weight`. CGs use **`dwba.angular-momentum` / Wigner 3j**.

  **Legendre vs m-sum:** For each **l**, **Y_{l0}(θ) ∝ P_l(cos θ)** (φ=0, real). The **unpolarized**
  sum that enters here is **(1/(2l_i+1)) Σ_{m_i,m_f} |A|²**; for **l_i=0** it collapses to a factor times
  **Σ_m |Y_{l_f m}(θ)|²** at a **single** θ. By the **addition theorem**, **Σ_m |Y_{l_f m}(θ,φ)|² =
  (2l_f+1)/(4π)** for **all** θ — that is **not** **P_{l_f}(cos θ)**; the **P_l** dependence cancels

  two directions **γ** apart — that **is** **P_l**, but a different object than **Σ_m |Y_lm(θ)|²**.)

   Optical potential parameters often depend on energy. This function
   implements common energy-dependent parameterizations. When :global-set
   is provided (e.g. :ch89 for Chapel Hill 89), uses that global potential
   instead of the built-in generic one.
   
   Parameters:
   - r: Radial distance (fm)
   - projectile: Projectile type (:p, :n, :d, :alpha)
   - target-A: Target mass number
   - E-lab: Lab energy (MeV)
   - l: Orbital angular momentum
   - s: Spin
   - j: Total angular momentum
   - Optional: :Z1, :Z2 charges, :R-C Coulomb radius, :global-set (e.g. :ch89)
   
   Returns: Complex potential U(r) in MeV
