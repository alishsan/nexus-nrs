  "Calculate Asymptotic Normalization Coefficient (ANC) from a MODEL bound state wavefunction.
   
   The ANC C is the coefficient in the asymptotic form:

   This fits the tail of the wavefunction produced by the potential used in
   solve-bound-state (e.g. Woods-Saxon). Prefer using ANCs from experimental
   data (e.g. (d,p) analysis) when available; pass those directly to
   anc-normalized-overlap or other callers instead of calling this.
   
   Parameters:
   - u: Bound state wavefunction (vector)
   - E: Bound state energy (MeV, negative)
   - l: Orbital angular momentum
   - mass-factor: Mass factor (2μ/ħ²) in MeV⁻¹·fm⁻²
   - h: Step size (fm)
   - r-fit-min: Minimum radius for fitting (fm, should be outside nuclear potential)

   |J M> = Σ_{m1,m2} <j1 m1 j2 m2 | J M> |j1 m1> |j2 m2>
   
   Parameters:
   - j1: First angular momentum (half-integer, e.g., 1/2, 1, 3/2, ...)
   - m1: First magnetic quantum number (-j1 ≤ m1 ≤ j1)
   - j2: Second angular momentum

   - J: Total angular momentum
   - M: Total magnetic quantum number (M = m1 + m2)

  "Calculate angular distribution for transfer reactions.
   
   The angular distribution for transfer reactions depends on the angular

   For a transfer reaction with angular momentum transfer L:

   selection weight (1 if L allowed, 0 if forbidden by triangle/parity), so some L dominate, others suppressed.
   
   Parameters:
   - T-amplitudes: Map of {L → T_L} transfer amplitudes for each angular momentum
   - theta: Scattering angle (radians)
   - phi: Azimuthal angle (radians, default 0 for coplanar scattering)

(defn transfer-total-cross-section
  "Calculate total cross-section by integrating differential cross-section.
   
   The total cross-section is:
   σ_total = ∫ dσ/dΩ dΩ = ∫₀^π ∫₀^2π dσ/dΩ(θ,φ) sin(θ) dθ dφ
   
   For coplanar scattering (φ=0), this simplifies to:
   σ_total = 2π ∫₀^π dσ/dΩ(θ) sin(θ) dθ
   
   Uses Simpson's rule for numerical integration.
   
   Parameters:
   - T-amplitudes: Map of {L → T_L} transfer amplitudes
   - S-factor: Spectroscopic factor
   - k-i: Wavenumber in entrance channel (fm⁻¹)
   - k-f: Wavenumber in exit channel (fm⁻¹)

(defn optical-potential-exit-channel
  "Calculate optical potential for exit channel of transfer reaction.
   
   Sets up the optical potential for the exit channel.
   
   Automatically uses:
   - CH89 (Chapel Hill 89) for protons (:p) and neutrons (:n)
   - Daehnick 1980 for deuterons (:d)
   
   You can override by passing :global-set explicitly.
   
   Parameters:
   - r: Radial distance (fm)
   - outgoing-type: Type of outgoing particle (:p, :n, :d, :alpha)
   - residual-A: Residual nucleus mass number
   - residual-Z: Residual nucleus charge number
   - E-lab: Lab energy in exit channel (MeV) or energy per nucleon for deuterons
   - l: Orbital angular momentum
   - s: Spin
   - j: Total angular momentum
   - Optional: :global-set to override auto-selection (:ch89, :daehnick80, or nil for generic)
   
   Returns: Complex potential U(r) in MeV
   
   Note: For transfer reactions, typically use CH89 for proton channel and Daehnick80 for deuteron channel."
